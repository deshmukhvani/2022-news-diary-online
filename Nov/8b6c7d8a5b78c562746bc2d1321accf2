Governor Ortom stated this Friday night, November 18th, 2022 in his brief remarks during a state banquet organised by the Rivers State Government in honour of members of the G-5 who are in Port Harcourt to flag-off PDP campaigns in the State ahead of the 2023 polls.

Anything less than that will not be accepted by us.”   He commended Rivers people for supporting Governor Wike, stating that the Rivers Governor was a bridge builder in the country. “I want to commend you for standing with our brother Governor Wike and supporting him and giving him the courage and the confidence to be a bridge builder, not just for Rivers State but for our country Nigeria.   “I congratulate him for the numerous works and achievements he has recorded for Rivers people. I also congratulate him for using the commissioning of projects to unite our country Nigeria,” Ortom stated.
