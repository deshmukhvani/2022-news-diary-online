By Auwalu Birnin Kudu  An Adamawa State based NGO, The Child Protection Network, has described the recent assent by Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri, to the state’s Child Protection Bill, as a welcomed development.  The commendation is contained in a statement signed by the coordinator of the group, Mr Sunday Kadiri, and made available to newsmen in Yola on Monday. Kadiri said the new legislation, which was recently enacted by the state House of Assembly, would significantly guard against child labour, molestation and other related offences.  He advised the government to inaugurate a child protection law implementation committee at both the state and local government levels, for wider and effective implementation.  “We appreciate the efforts of all stakeholders for the technical and financial support, which led to the enactment, passage and signing of the Bill into law by the executive,” Kadiri said in the statement.  He also lauded the efforts of Malala Fund and Charity Africa, for their technical support and participation during public hearings on the proposed law, as well as the advocacy visits to the assembly.  Kadiri, therefore called for the support of residents in responding positively to the law, adding that the children required quick responses and protection against inimical practices capable of jeopardising their future.
