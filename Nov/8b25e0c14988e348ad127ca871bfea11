Speaking on behalf of the new executives, Rollas said the new leadership would consolidate on the successes of the AGN in the last three years and be more committed to the welfare of members.  He, therefore, called on members across the country to shun all divisive tendencies and work with the new executives to build a formidable AGN.  “ I can say today that all we have done in the past three years was foundation laying, so let us join hands and build on the successes we have so far achieved,” he said. Rollas, who was first elected as National President of the AGN in 2019, said a date would soon be announced for the inauguration of the new leadership.(NAN)
