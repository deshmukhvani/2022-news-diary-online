by Isaiah Eka Godswill Akpabio, former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, says he plans to approach the Supreme Court to seek redress over Appeal Court judgement nullifying his election as All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for Akwa Ibom North West in 2023 poll.  Akpabio, also the Vice-Chairman, APC Presidential Campaign Council, said this  in a statement on Tuesday in Uyo. “My attention has been drawn to the judgement delivered by the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, directing INEC to delist my name from its list as the APC senatorial candidate for Akwa Ibom North West Senatorial District in the 2023 election.  “It is instructive to mention that I was not a party in the said appeal, though orders were made against me and my interest. “Whilst awaiting a copy of the said judgement to be made available to me and any other interested party, it is important to state that I am a lawyer by training and a law abiding citizen of this country and I am bound by our laws and judgements emanating from our courts including the one under reference.  “My lawyers on my advice and brief have commenced the scrutiny of the contents of the judgement as read, for the purposes of seeking appropriate legal redress. I am aware that the Supreme Court of Nigeria has the final say in these matters,” he said.  “I therefore, strongly advise my supporters, APC members and all my constituents to remain calm and law abiding, as they continue their campaigns for the successes of the APC in Akwa Ibom North West, Akwa Ibom and Nigeria at large.”(NAN)
