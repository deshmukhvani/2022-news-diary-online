Senior Vice Chairman/Editor-In-Chief of LEADERSHIP, Mr. Azu Ishiekwene, has won the Columnist of the Year Award in the 30th edition of the Nigeria Media Merit Award (NMMA) 2022, held in Lagos on Sunday. Mr. Ishiekwene, fondly called Azu, beat Abimbola Adelakun and Tunde Odesola both of PUNCH to win the award in an entry fielded by Vanguard, which among other media houses in Nigeria and abroad, publishes Azu’s syndicated column weekly.  The NMMA Board is chaired by advertising guru and former CEO of Lintas, Mr. Dele Adetiba. The award in this category is named after Alade Odunewu, one of Nigeria’s all-time best in punditry. Odunewu was famous for his wit and clarity of language.
