The Planetarium and museum projects when implemented is expected to boost tourism in the space agency with 2,160 tourists, sky divers on a weekly basis. The tourism activities will further generate N30 billion in 15 years.

NAN recalls that in August, the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) placed the space agency’s Planetarium, Museum and Satellite Broadband projects on concession.   The ICRC, however, announced that Atlantic Factorial Limited, a Lagos-based space to cloud analytics company was the preferred bidder of the projects. The commission also said the Special Purpose Vehicle would be  Milky-Way Visuals Limited.   A Planetarium is a dome-shaped building in which images of stars, planets and constellations are projected for public entertainment and education.(NAN)
