He quoted the State APC Chairman, Alhaji Isa Sadiq-Achida, while speaking on behalf of the party as assuring the new member and his supporters of equal treatment with all other members. This is a great development for our party and I am certain that with the caliber of personalities the APC has continued to received ahead of the General Elections, we are truly blessed. “I am truly confident that the defection of Bojo-Bodinga, is a good omen for the APC and an indication of the party’s victory at all levels,” he said.
