According to Marwa, “I’ll like to appreciate the French government for its support as one of our leading partners. We have received tremendous help from France not only in terms of training but also equipment. The support was capped with my recent visit to France where we received warm reception at all the institutions visited and the training promised was promptly organized. We’re grateful for that and we are looking forward to more collaboration and support.” In his response, Verin said “we’re proud to work with NDLEA because your officers and men are very smart and professional and that’s why you’re getting results, hence our priority in terms of support for NDLEA is in the area of training. Our trainers who have been here to train your men are specialists and top in the field. We’ll do this for a very long time and we’re glad to work with you.”
