By Yunus Yusuf  The Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) has donated N50 million to support communities that were affected by floods across the country.  Mr Clement Isong, Chief Executive Officer of MOMAN, said this in a statement in Lagos on Monday. Isong said that the recent flooding, a humanitarian disaster, did not appear to be getting the attention it deserved.  He noted that the pictures of sheer devastation in communities in various parts of Nigeria were horrific and underscored the need for corporate organisations to lend their support. “In previous emergencies such as COVID-19, Nigerians rallied round each other but with the floods, the rest of the world appears to be taking things more serious than Nigeria is.  “It is sad that the flooding which I see as a humanitarian disaster is not treated with the seriousness it deserves. Receiving the donation, the Secretary General of the Nigerian Red Cross Society, Mr Abubakar Kende, was ecstatic at the display of social responsibility by MOMAN.  Kende said that the funds would truly be used to alleviate the effects of the flooding. According to Kende, the Nigerian Red Cross Society has come a long way and has accountability as its watchword. “It is so gratifying in these times to meet an organisation that actually has the spirit of volunteerism and humanity embedded within its core. “About two weeks ago, the Nigerian Red Cross Society launched an emergency appeal in order to raise 13 million Swiss Francs for the flood victims across Nigeria. “These funds are targeted at supporting up to 500,000 displaced people and focus on the provision of basic food, health, care, water, sanitation, hygiene promotion, search and rescue. “Others include rapid NEEDS assessments, deployments of emergency first aid teams and many more services required to alleviate the general suffering brought on by the effects of flooding,” he said.
