The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) observed that thousands of party faithful were seen signing and dancing as they go into the venue. NAN also noticed youths moving round some streets with placards shouting the names of their candidates.  As at 10:30am, the Rwang Pam Stadium,Jos, venue of the event is adorned with different  posters, billboards and many other campaign materials and almost filled to capacity. Meanwhile, the security personnel were having tough time trying to regulate the number of supporters entering the stadium to avoid overcrowding.  Plateau APC Publicity Secretary, Mr Sylvanus Namang, said the massive turn-out was an indication that the party is widely accepted. Namang told NAN that the people outside the stadium were more than those inside. The publicity secretary urged those outside not to insist on coming in, stating that there are television screens outside for them to view what is going on. “This is a momentous crowd, the stadium is already filled to capacity. “We have three screens outside the stadium, just stay there and watch, I can assure you that you will not miss anything,” he said.
