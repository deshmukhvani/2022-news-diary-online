Zamfara State Gov Bello Mohammed Matawallen Maradun has offered to allow access to EFCC to ransack the property it alleged to have found stashed with humongous amount of money for laundering through cash payment of salaries. Ibrahim Magaji Dosara, Commissioner of Information, Zamfara state said in a statement that “the offer became necessary in view of the grand designed connivance by enemies of Zamfara state and vanguards of disruption to rupture the hard-earned reputation and progress of the Governor. “To demonstrate the commitment of the state government in this direction, the Gov has already directed his attorneys to officially communicate to the agency this offer and list of demands in this direction, including retracting the fake news by the SaharaReporters against his person”. Dosara said, “Government will not take it lightly with anyone who tries to add salt to security injury inflicted on the good people of zamfara through tarnishing the good image of the Gov to be distracted from the efforts and successes being recorded in the fight against banditry in the state. The Governor has since assumption (of) office about four years ago as the Executive Governor of the state, been administering the state in the most responsible ways and manner with credibility, in spite of the enormous security challenges and meagre resources at the disposal of the government, , according to Dosara. c He added that the governor cannot be allowed to turn a subject of relegation and ridicule in the eye of the public. “Zamfara state government under Gov Bello Mohammed Matawalle has never paid its workers salary through table payment and cannot afford doing so at this material time when the government agreed to implement the national minimum wage of Thirty Thousand Naira ( N30,000). “Gov Matawalle has been committed to the wellbeing, welfare and the security of lives and property of the people of the state and will not allow enemies of the state to distract him from the good job he has been doing.”
