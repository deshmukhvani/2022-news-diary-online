By Abbas Bamalli  The Nigeria Immigration Service Special Border Command in Jibia, Katsina State, has retrieved 513 national identity cards and voter cards from some foreigners.  The Controller of the command, Kelechi Ekeoba-Jones, disclosed this while briefing newsmen on Monday at the newly established Jibia border command. He said that 202 voter cards and 311 national identity cards were retrieved by the command.  “Some foreign nationals were found in possession of the Federal Republic of Nigeria voters card and National identity cards issued to them in various states of the country. “A total of 513 voter and national identity cards were retrieved from them in various formations of the command.  “Therefore, we are soliciting for the support of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to engage us whenever a voter registration exercise is going to be conducted again. “Only the immigration officials can identify foreigners through our techniques whenever they come to register at any registration centre across the country,” the comptroller said. According to him, the NIS Headquarters has been engaging INEC in that regard, because it is the only agency that can identify who is not a Nigerian. “We are calling on INEC, at any point of registration, they should solicit for the help of our people to avoid registering foreigners. “So also the body responsible for the national identity card registration; it should engage more of our officers whenever the exercise will commence because it’s very important,” he said.
