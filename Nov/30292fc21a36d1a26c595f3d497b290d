By Muhammad Nasir The Northern Broadcast Media Owners Association (NBMOA) says it is organising a media chat to offer presidential candidates the opportunity to explain their agenda ahead of the 2023 General Elections. The group, in a statement issued to newsmen on Monday in Sokoto said the activity was in order for the candidates to reveal their commitment in confronting the country’s extant challenges.   The statement signed by Alhaji Abdullahi Yelwa,its Chairman, said that the presidential candidates would have the chance to explore their blueprints particularly for the North. “The North is confronted by a myriad of existential challenges which have seemingly defied solutions. “This time around, the Nigerian electorate need tangible and well thought out answers to the country’s challenges.   “It is not enough for candidates to promise to end insecurity or drug abuse. “We want to know how they plan to achieve it. We need concrete plans and verifiable timelines,” he said. Yelwa further said the electorate in the North needed to know what each candidate was planning for the zone and the country in general.   “The North, has been ruined by the scourge of terrorism and banditry, youth unemployment, drug abuse, out-of-school children problem and the plight of the Internally Displaced Persons, among many others. “We want to know what each candidate intends to do to address these challenges,” Yelwa added.   He assured that as stakeholders, their organisation will continue to partner with political leaders to evolve a people-oriented strategy for salvaging the North and the nation. According to him, the group, which its membership comprising over 100 radio and television stations, with over 80 million listeners, will commence the media chat on Tuesday with the NNPP candidate, Dr Rabiu Kwankwaso.   “The media chat will be telecast live by Liberty TV , Trust TV and other broadcasting stations all across the region,” he said.
