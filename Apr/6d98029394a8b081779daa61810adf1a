He said it was imperative for the party members to unite to win upcoming elections in the country. “It is important for PDP family to come together to rescue the country. “We must eschew all bitterness and put personal interests aside and look at the collective interest of Nigerians as well as the party.  “So that when Nigeria becomes a better country, all of us will rejoice and will be happy with the situation. “But if we continue to fight each other and only promote our personal interests, we will end up loosing. Yero also admonished the youths to use the 2023 elections to establish themselves as “true leaders of tomorrow.”  He advised the youth not to allow themselves be hoodwink by self-seeking politicians and vote for credible leaders to ensure a better future for the country. On security, Yero urged relevant authorities to use all the resources available to address the problem. “There is need to create more jobs for people because part of the problem have been lack of jobs.  “That is why we have so many informants around, because they have no jobs, they easily give information for a small token,” he said.
