According to the minister, the Council rejected the proposal to grant pardon to one of the prisoners sentenced to 120 years for stealing over N25 billion.“The reason for seeking for pardon was because of life threatening illness.“The second person was convicted for forgery, sentenced to 14 years and had stayed in prison for a year and six months. “The third person was obtaining money by false pretences and was sentenced to seven years,” he explained.Also speaking, the Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, George Akume, disclosed that the Council approved the conferment of National Honours on 434 Nigerians.
