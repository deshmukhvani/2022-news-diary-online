By Emmanuel OloniruhaFormer Vice President and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential Aspirant, Atiku Abubakar, has called on Nigerians to emulate the virtues of love and sacrifice which characterised the life of Jesus Christ. Abubakar made the call in a statement by his media office in Abuja on Thursday to mark the Easter celebration.  He said that the two qualities of love and sacrifice were essential to the unity that Nigeria desperately needed at this moment. He said that the Easter celebration was a time for deep reflection as it marked the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and his victory over death. “It is a time to reach out to our brothers and sisters in need.  “It is also a time for all of us — regardless of faith, or ethnicity — to come together to pray for the peace of our nation. “ We must all remain constant in our efforts to promote unity — across all lines — because united, our nation remains stronger and we thrive as a people,” he said.  Abubakar expressed belief that in this season, Nigeria would rise and overcome her national challenges. “Our shared experiences are bringing us to the conclusion that no matter what the forces of evil can do, we as Nigerians, united as one in doing good, can and will prevail,” he said.  He also encouraged Nigeria’s leaders to use the opportunity of the Christian celebration of Easter to reflect on their stewardship to their people and to the nation. “Our leaders at all levels should follow the virtues that define this season – sacrifice, love, and charity – and come together to help all Nigerians resolve the differences that divide us,” he said.(NAN)
