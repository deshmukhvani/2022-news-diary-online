Orji advised the opposition to desist from fruitless ochestrations against the governor, who was God’s servant and an accomplished leader.  “We will expose those who are using the social media to propagate fake news in undermining the governor’s presidential ambition. “We thank the public, especially those who called our attention to this falsehood and assure that collectively, we would build the Nigeria of our dreams under Umahi in 2023,” the commissioner said.
