The Director Digital Economy Department at the Commission, also recalled efforts of the Commission in ensuring that the seven Infrastructure Companies (InfraCos) already licensed by the telecom regulator accelerated their infrastructure deployment across the six geo-political zones of the country.The Director commended the organisers for the calibre of sponsors listed for the expo and asserted that the event will be a hub for stakeholders such as Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), InfraCos and international organisations, and offer them the opportunity to glean developments in the country and to deepen their interests in promoting innovation, competition.  In his comments, the NCC Director, Consumer Affairs Bureau, Efosa Idehen, explained that the Commission has evidently adopted an open-door policy and particularly through its consumer-centric initiatives. He also emphasised that the Commission appreciates collaboration with stakeholders whose programmes allow consumers to interact with the service providers.  “The NCC prioritises the consumers. We therefore see this forthcoming expo as another opportunity for the consumer’s voice to be heard as they interface with service providers. This is based on our regulatory mandate of ensuring that consumers of telecommunications services get value for their money and are treated right as critical stakeholders in the telecom ecosystem,” Idehen stated to reiterate NCC’s commitment to the promotion, protection and defence of the interests of telecom consumers.
