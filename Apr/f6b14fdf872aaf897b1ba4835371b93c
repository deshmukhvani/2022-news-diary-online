Lau said during her inauguration that her focus for the next five years would be to actualise the enduring goals of the council.  She said “the new leadership which I will be heading will build on the successes of my predecessors and take it to an enviable pinnacle we all wish for the council.”  The new NCWS boss said she accepted the important role as a responsibility that she held seriously.“I want to say, without fear of contradiction, that even though I am today the president by consensus, it was indeed a difficult process which I intend to cherish tillthe end of my life.”  She pledged her determination to work toward improving the welfare, progress and standard of living of women in Nigeria.  She added that “I will work with relevant stakeholders to increase the role of women in politics and in policy formulation through unfettered access to decision making.  “As a council, we want to ensure, through legal and political means, that women have the opportunity to participate in all national endeavour as responsible members of their communities.”  She expressed the council’s solidarity with Nigerian women, noting, however, that “the ninth assembly denied women the opportunity of inclusion and representation in governance by voting against the gender bills resulting in complete rejection of the gender inclusion bills..  “At a time when women in Africa and across the globe are gaining significant strides, the Nigerian federal parliament had apparently spoken loud and clear that they do not want progress for society.  “In spite of this move by the men at the National Assembly, we will not relent, as we shall continue to fight for our rights until we achieve what we set out to achieve.”(NAN)
