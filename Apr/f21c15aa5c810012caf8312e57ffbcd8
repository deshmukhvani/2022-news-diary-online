By Cecilia Ologunagba The UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, has called on Muslims to build a peaceful world, saying the holy month of Ramadan is a time for reflection and learning, an opportunity to come together and uplift each other. Ramadan begins on Saturday and is celebrated by millions of Muslims around the world.  Ramadan, the month when fasting from dawn to sunset is obligatory, begins and ends around the crescent moon, a symbol used extensively in Ramadan decorations. In his video message marking the holy month on Friday, the UN chief said that he personally, had returned to fasting in solidarity, a practice he began as High Commissioner for Refugees, a title he held from 2005 through to 2015.  “Every Ramadan, I had the honour of visiting Muslim countries, fasting in solidarity, and breaking bread with people. “Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic made that impossible, but I am happy to resume this tradition this year,” Guterres said.  Citing the Holy Quran, the UN chief said that God created nations and tribes so that we might know one another and called on people to work hand in hand for the safety, dignity and prosperity of all women and men According to him, the world is going through times of tragedy and suffering.  The secretary-general said his thoughts and heart are with everyone facing conflict, displacement and fear, adding that we must learn from each other and together, build a peaceful world. (NAN)
