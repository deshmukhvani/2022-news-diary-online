Adedugbe, during the donation on Thursday, said: “Today’s donation is a star project for our club. “Our club just got chartered.  “We got recognised by the international body in February and we felt we have to do a project to mark the official recognition of the club, but prior to that on the 10th of January, which is the International Inner Wheel Day worldwide, we donated consumables worth about N300,000 to the hospital and we promised to give them a baby incubator.    “That is why we are here.” A past Board Director, Doyin Abiodun-Oredein, also stated that the club touches lives through the little that it can do.  Abiodun-Oredein said: “Our objective is to promote true friendship to encourage service and to foster national understanding. “Through the little we can do, we put smiles on people’s faces.  “We don’t get funds from anybody. “We raise our funds ourselves. “We try to touch as many lives as possible. “No counting the cost.”  Inner Wheel is an international organisation for women that encourages the ideals of personal services through services to humanity.
