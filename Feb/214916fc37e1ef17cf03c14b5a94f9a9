It is a clear road map that Nigerians have aligned with the PDP in its mission to rescue and rebuild Nigeria from the misrule of the APC”, he stated.  Governor Ortom was pleased that despite the intimidation by agents of the state government in Plateau, the people demonstrated their resolve and indomitable spirit in the pre-election, during the election and even post-election. He assured Nigerians that the PDP will live up to its billings by working for the peace, welfare and restoration of security of the citizens of the country. Governor Ortom promised that PDP will return Nigeria to an egalitarian society where every citizen irrespective of tribe or religion can pursue his or her legitimate ambition in any part of Nigeria without fear of intimidation or molestation.

And we will not disappoint Nigerians in our resolve to rebuild the country from the ruins of the current misrule.” The PDP candidate in the Jos North/Bassa Federal Constituency bye-election, Hon. Musa Agah Avia was declared the winner after he polled a total of 40,343 votes.
