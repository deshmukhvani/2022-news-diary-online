On Wednesday 23rd February 2022, I was at the just-concluded seminar on “Exploring New Approaches for Enhanced CTCOIN Operations in the Armed Forces of Nigeria” for students of Senior Staff Course 44/2022 of the prestigious Armed Forces Command and Staff College Jaji, Kaduna State, at the famous Ihejirika Auditorium, Jaji Military Cantonment. In my lecture titled “The Non-Kinetic Approach to Counterterrorism and Counterinsurgency (CTCOIN) efforts: An Appraisal”, I critically examined the non-kinetic efforts in Nigeria’s counterterrorism and counterinsurgency campaign and suggested ways forward. Air Commodore AK Famuyiwa, former Director of Public Relations and Information of the Nigerian Air Force and a Directing Staff at the National Defence Staff College, Nigeria, was the moderator while Group Captain PP Okwonkwo, Navy Captain SB Ayuba, and Colonel P Elayo, of the Department of Civil -Military Affairs (Army), Yusuf Mohammed, representative of the Director-General of the Department of State Services and Commandant SO Dan, representative of the Commandant General of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).
