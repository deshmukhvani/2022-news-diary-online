Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Gov. Seyi Makinde and other prominent Nigerians are among dignitaries expected at the ‘Day of Tributes’ in honour of the late former Oyo Governor, Chief Adebayo Alao-Akala. A statement signed by Alhaji Kehinde Olaosebikan on behalf of the organisers in Ibadan on Sunday said that the event would feature tributes from prominent Nigerians, lecture and cultural display.   The News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) reports that the event is the first in a week-long of events organised to celebrate the life of Alao-Akala who died on Jan. 12. The event is organised by a conglomerate of politicians across party lines in Oyo State under the joint chairmanship of Chief Wale Ohu and Rep. Olusegun Olayiwola.   Olaosebikan said that a lecture entitled ‘Otunba Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala: The Life of a Humane Politician’ would be delivered by retired federal permanent secretary and eminent scholar, Prof. Tunji Olaopa. He said that Osinbajo and Makinde would lead other prominent Nigerians to the occasion, where they would express their views on the life of the departed governor Olaosebikan said that among others expected at the event are labour, market, associations, students, women and youth leaders as well as captain of industries.   He said that necessary arrangements had been concluded to give the late former governor a befitting burial in all ramifications. “As a governor for four years and 11 months, Alao-Akala was exceptional in governance; pragmatic, compassionate, sagacious and uncommonly generous.   “All these virtues and his delightful relationships with the high and low in the society earned him the appellation of ‘Oyato Governor’. He was indeed unique and uncommon,” he said.(NAN)
