By Rosemary Ogbonnaya The Academic Staff Union of Universities has faulted the promotion of Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Pantami, as a professor. The union after its National Executive Council meeting declared the promotion as “illegal”   This was declared at a press conference addressed by the President of ASUU, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke. He said, “You cannot be a minister and a lecturer in a university. It is an encouragement of illegality.” The ASUU president said Pantami has to quit as a minister and be tried for doing double jobs within the same federal system.   “He is not qualified. Pantami should not be treated as a professor,” he said. Pantami was among seven readers (Associate professors) elevated by the Governing Council of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, FUTO, at its 186th meeting last year September 6.
