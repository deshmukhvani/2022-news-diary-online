He stated that Osinbajo would join other leaders across Africa and beyond to grace the event scheduled to hold at the Samuel Doe Stadium in Monrovia.

On July 26, 1847, the country proclaimed its independence and became the Republic of Liberia. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Amb. Zubairu Dada and Special Adviser to the President on Economic Matters, Amb. Adeyemi Dipeolu, are on Osinbajo’s entourage. They are expected back in Nigeria on Feb. 15. (NAN)
