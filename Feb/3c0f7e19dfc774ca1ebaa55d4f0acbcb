A frontline civil society activist, Dr. Kabir Hamisu Kura, has warned party leaders, especially APC and PDP to be wary of electing persons with questionable characters, to fill the leadership position of their parties. The activist who is the Executive Director of Initiative for Community Development Initiative, CDI gave this warning today in Kano in response to a recent publication in the media that some APC governors are lobbying the President to have a concensus candidate for the Chairmanship of the ruling party among them. Reacting to the publication, Kura frowned at such move which he described as sinister, undemocratic and a repeat of the ugly pasts. “We are tired of recycling same old politicians that have occupied the space for too long, and to the detriment of the people. We must demonstrate our readiness for change. In his words, he quoted Albert Einstein as saying “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results” This is what the world needs and Nigerians are watching. The governors he said are largely responsible for myriad of the nation’s problems today as we see daily their efforts to truncate democratic dividends. The recent electoral bill that took so much time to this point is the behind-the-scene manouvering of these governors, he added. While commending the People’s Democratic Party, PDP for electing a younger person into the leadership position, he urged APC, being the ruling party to emulate them and elect a younger politician with no tainted record to lead them. This he added, is the current trend worldwide and Nigeria should not be an exception.
