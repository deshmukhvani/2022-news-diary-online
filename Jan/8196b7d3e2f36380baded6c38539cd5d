The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says it has not zoned its Presidential ticket for 2023 general elections to any part of the country. The party made the clarification in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Debo Ologunagba in Abuja on Saturday.   Ologunagba said that the attention of the party had been drawn to comments and speculations from certain individuals claiming that PDP had zoned its presidential ticket to a particular part of the country. Ologunagba described the speculation as completely misleading as it did not, in any way, represent the position of the Party. “For the avoidance of doubt, the PDP emphatically and unequivocally states that it has not zoned its presidential ticket to any part of the country.   “The PDP is a political party founded on democratic principles and every action of the party, including zoning, is based on extensive consultations, discussions and consideration of all the issues as well as the various tendencies and interests across the nation. “This is with the main objective of ensuring that the unity, peaceful co-existence and development of our nation are reinforced and promoted.” PDP stated.   Ologunagba urged Nigerians, the party teeming members and supporters to completely disregard the unfounded zoning claims as being peddled. “Our Party also cautions those behind the claims to desist forthwith,” the statement warned. He urged Nigerians to remain united and focused as the party joins forces for the task ahead. (NAN)
