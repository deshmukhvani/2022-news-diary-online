The Adamawa State Independent Electoral Commission (ADSIEC) says it has notified all registered political parties of the 90 days’ notice ahead of the council polls. This is contained in a statement signed by Alhaji Isa Shettima, the Executive Chairman of the commission, and released to newsmen by the Information Officer, Mr. Innocent Daniel, on Monday in Yola.   According to the statement, the directive is with immidiate effect. It read, “Ultimately, the state government has made adequate provision for the state Electoral Commission to proceed and conduct election in the 21 local government councils in the state. “It is in this regard that the Commission is hereby giving 90 days’ election notice  to all registered political parties in the state.   “The notice commences from Jan. 10, 2022 to April 9, 2022 as required by the local government electoral law,” Shettima said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the LG polls was earlier scheduled to hold on Dec. 4, 2021, but was suspended by the state government allegedly due to lack of funds. (NAN)
