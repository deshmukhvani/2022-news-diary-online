President Muhammadu Buhari has reacted to the loss by Nigeria’s Super Eagles Football Team to Tunisia on Sunday in Garoua, Cameroon, saying that although the team did not live up to our expectations in the tournament, both officials and players deserve commendation for the tough fight they put up.   According to a statement signed by Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media & Publicity), Malam Garba Shehu, President Buhari said: “They gave everyone the confidence that they were up to it, and I am sure it was something they could have achieved. Nonetheless, we should not write them off” .  Buhari urged Nigerians to encourage the players to do better next time, especially in view of the World Cup qualification matches that have been lined up for them.  The President directed the football authorities in the country to undertake a critical assessment on the Eagles’ performance at the Cup of Nations tournament and encouraged the general public to send their suggestions to the Nigeria Football Federation so that it will reflect and plan well for a better outing in the forthcoming World Cup competition.
