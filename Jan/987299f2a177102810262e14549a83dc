Some members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have called off their initial plan to protest against the party’s Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the  group, under the auspices of  APC Core Supporters Network, last week, issued a threat to shut down the national secretariat of the party over its interim leadership.   But in a statement signed by its National President, Mr Maxwell Gowon on Saturday  in Abuja,  the group said its members were misled, misinformed and misguided by some disgruntled elements. Gowon said they knew better now and had already apologised to the  Gov.  Mai Mala Buni-led committee for almost being used by enemies of the APC to truncate the progress recorded.   Speaking after its consultative meeting in Abuja on Saturday on the state of the party, the group alleged that they were initially carried away by some elders whom they thought meant well for the APC. He said they, however, made a U-turn after discovering that these so-called leaders were attempting to brainwash them into turning against progressives.   The group, therefore, said it could not  allow itself to be used against the committee that had done so well to rescue the party from where these very so-called elders had taken it. It added that it was  now convinced that holding the party’s congress anytime in February without resolving the issue which the committee was first appointed to resolve would  be playing into the hands of the opposition that had planted moles to destroy the party.   While urging the  Buni-led committee to sustain its transformation, the group unequivocally urged  all APC support groups, supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari and all progressives in the country to  know that the earlier threats of protest against the committee had been  withdrawn and suspended indefinitely.
