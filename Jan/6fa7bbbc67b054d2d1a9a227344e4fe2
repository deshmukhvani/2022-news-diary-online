According to him, the country is able to manage the number of cancers detected very early. He commended the council for assuring they were accredited by the world regulatory agency. He advised the council to work harder because in due time the accreditation would be reviewed.    The minister further said that the accreditation would enhance Federal Government’s effort to reposition the health sector. He noted that nine laboratory had been accredited and urged the Federal Teaching Hospitals, Federal Medical Centres and Specialist Hospitals to key into the council’s application programmes to change the current narratives.
