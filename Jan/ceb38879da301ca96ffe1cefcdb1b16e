The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, says the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration has completed 263 ecological projects across the country. Mohammed briefed State House correspondents after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Wednesday, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.   Buhari is away in Banjul, The Gambia, for the inauguration of President Adama Barrow, who was re-elected for a second term. The minister said that the administration had intervened in 291 ecological projects so far. “There were two memos presented behalf of the president; the first of the memo is the approval that council granted for the award of contracts for the 2022 emergency procurement (first and second quarters) accelerated soil erosion, flood and pollution control intervention projects.   “I am sure you were aware that there is an ecological project office which intervenes regularly; it controls soil erosion and flood in favour of states. “The Ecological Project Office receives complaints of serious threat to community and to the land and it is instructive to note that during this administration, we have intervened in at least, 291 projects. “Out of which 263 have been completed and handed over to beneficiary communities and institutions while a total of 28 are at various stages of completion,’’ he said.   He said that 14 ecological projects were approved by FEC at the meeting.
