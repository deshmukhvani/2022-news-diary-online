By Rosemary Ogbonnaya Executive Secretary Secretary, National Commission for Persons With Disabilities, NCPWD, Mr. James David Lalu has applauded the recent decision of the Director General, National Identity Management Commission Engr. Aliyu A. Aziz who has directed that all the Electronic Registration Centers (ERCs) across all their zones in Nigeria should commence special services to Persons With Disabilities and other susceptible Nigerians. Lalu made this known recently in Abuja while speaking to some members of the disability community who had come to commiserate with him on the demise of HRH the Mishkaham Mwaghavul of Mangu Local government of Plateau State.   In his address, the ES also stated that the resolve will go a long way in reducing the stress PWDs experience from time to time while trying to get registered with NIMC. He however, disclosed that about 35 million persons with disabilities in Nigeria need to be captured on the NIMC register for proper identification and inclusion into government policies and programmes.   He however, bemoaned the attitude of some pension administrators who create unwarranted problems for the PWDs during verification exercise year in year on without substantive results. In his response, the spokesman of the group Dr. Victor Mmadu expressed his gratitude and thanked the ES for his unprecedented show of passion towards advancing the course of Persons With Disabilities.   He prayed that the soul of the late Patriach reposes in “God’s own divan”.
