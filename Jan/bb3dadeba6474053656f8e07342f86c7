President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the passing of a leading Muslim Scholar and Imam, Bayero University, Kano, Ahmad Ibrahim, recalling his noble expositions of the prophetic traditions of Prophet Muhammad (SAW). President Buhari, in a condolence message by his media aide, Malam Garba Shehu, on Friday in Abuja, said Ahmad would be remembered for his impeccable service to Islam and the nation, as well as his passion towards public enlightenment.   “It is really sad news for all of us to learn that our beloved Dr. Ahmad is no more. “He was a personality of faith, who dedicated his life to Islamic education. “His emphasis on the unity of Muslims, good education and the rights of women will always be remembered.   “We offer our heartfelt condolences and pray for the eternal repose of his soul,” the president said. He recalled that the late Imam authored several books in his lifetime, among the latest being his translation of the more than 1,000 year-old “Muwatta Malik,” a 1173-page book into Hausa, at which presentation he (President Buhari) was represented. The president conveyed the nation’s condolences to the bereaved family, the Bayero University community and to his countless students and followers in Kano and in West Africa.   In BUK where he taught and led Muslims in prayer for more than 30 years before he set up the “Darul Hadith,” meaning the home of prophetic traditions, an Islamic Centre next door, the news of his death sent shock and gloomy waves across the community and beyond.
