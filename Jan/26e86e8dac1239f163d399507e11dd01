Gov. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti has described the death of Mrs Angela Folarin, wife of Sen. Teslim Folarin, representing Oyo Central Senatorial District, as very painful and unfortunate. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Mrs Angela Nwaka Folarin died in the United Kingdom on Friday, aged 48.   Fayemi, in a statement issued on Saturday in Ado-Ekiti by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, urged Sen. Folarin and the family to be consoled with the fact that the Almighty God is the one that gives and takes. The governor said losing a supportive wife could be both painful and devastating. He, however, prayed that God would give the lawmaker the fortitude to bear the loss.   Fayemi, who is also the Chairman, Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF), said the late Mrs Folarin was not onlya pillar of support to her husband, but also committed personal resources to provide succour to the vulnerable and less privileged in the society. “The news of Mrs Folarin’s death was shocking, sad and devastating. She was a virtuous woman and dutiful wife, who showed support for her husband and family, and equally provided succour for the vulnerable.   “Losing such a wonderful woman who is a pillar of support can be very devastating. My heart is with my dear brother, Senator Folarin and the family at this very trying time. “It is my prayer that the good Lord will grant the family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.   “On behalf of my wife, the government and people of Ekiti State, I commiserate with the family of the deceased and the government and people of Oyo State on this loss”, Fayemi added.
