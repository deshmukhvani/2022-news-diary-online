By EricJames Ochigbo The leadership of the House of Representatives on Wednesday in Abuja frowned at the failure of the nationâ€™s service chiefs to appear at a strategic security meeting. The house leadership called the meeting in the aftermath of a series of terrorist attacks in Kaduna State.   The lawmakers, led by the Deputy Speaker, Rep. Ahmed Wase, expressed their disappointment at the service chiefs and refused to meet their representatives. He said that the meeting followed a resolution of the house and the invitation letters sent to the service chiefs were very clear.   Wase said the house was not seeing results of the money appropriated in the light of the recent terrorists attacks on the Kaduna International Airport and a Kaduna-bound passenger train. The deputy speaker said that the parliament needed to ask questions which the service chiefs must answer in person, and not through representatives.   He said that sending representatives with excuses was not acceptable, saying that it was only in the Nigerian parliament that people are summoned and they would refused to show up. Wase said that the attacks were a result of lack of synergy between the different arms of government, though the parliament had been very cooperative and faithful in the appropriation of funds.   In his ruling, Wase called off the meeting and rescheduled it for Thursday, March 31 at 3 p.m at the same venue. (NAN)
