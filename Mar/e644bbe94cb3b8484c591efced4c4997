United Nation Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has donated drugs and medical consumables worth 438,972 dollars to improve maternal, neonatal and child survival in Borno and Yobe States. Phoung Nguyen, UNICEF’s Chief of Field Office, Maiduguri, stated this in a statement issued by its Comminication Officer, Folashade Adebayo, on Wednesday in Maiduguri.   He said the gesture was to improve reproductive and child healthcare services among others in conflict-affected communities in the Northeast. Nguyen listed the donated items to include antimalarials, analgesics, antibiotics and equipments.   According to him, the UN agency will provide additional 500,000 dollars to support the implementation of the Primary Healthcare Memorandum of Understanding it signed with the states. Nguyen noted that women and children had paid the highest cost of the 13-year-old conflict in the region. “In 2020, the lives of 170 children lost directly or indirectly each day due to reduced access to healthcare services.   “We are laying the foundation for optimum wellbeing for thousands of children born and yet to be born. “With this intervention, pregnant women in Yobe and Borno States will be able to access health facilities in their communities, and receive essential drugs, tests and basic medical support in primary healthcare facilities close to their homes,” he said.
