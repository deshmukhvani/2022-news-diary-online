Chairman of the joint committee, Sen. Suleiman Kwari, in his presentation, said that the Public Interest Disclosure bill also known as the ‘ Whistle Blower Bill,’ was a critical component in the anti-corruption war that needed a streamlined framework for its implementation. According to the lawmaker, the bill sought to strengthen the Public Complaints Commission (PCC). It will also provide a legal and institutional framework for the regulation and management of public interest disclosure and protection of the discloser.
