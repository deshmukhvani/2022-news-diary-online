The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that three senators; Abdullahi Adamu, Sani Musa and Tanko Al-Makura were contesting for the APC national chairman in the March 26 national convention.  “I am not aware that the APC senate caucus has adopted any senator for the position of the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress. “I know that three senators are contesting and there was no where or occasion when we took any decision to adopt any particular candidate.  “I will be very happy if any of them emerges as the APC national chairman on Saturday.The emergence of any of the three senators would be a good omen to our institution. “Senators Abdullahi Adamu, Sani Musa and Tanko Al-Makura are in the race,” he said.(NAN)
