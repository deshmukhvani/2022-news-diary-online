The Ekiti Government has distributed 2500 free JAMB E-Registration pin to indigent students of Ekiti to encourage them in the ambition to pursue tertiary education. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the wife of Ekiti State Governor, Mrs Bisi Fayemi announced this in Ado Ekiti at the flag-off of the distribution exercise on Friday in Ado-Ekiti.  She observed that despite the huge financial implications of this educational programme, government would not relent in evolving good strategies to bequeath a remarkable legacy of functional and qualitative education to the future leaders. The governor’s wife therefore expressed hope that the beneficiaries would reward the state government by preparing adequately for the examination and have outstanding results.  “You will recall that this administration distributed 3000 forms in 2019, 2000 in 2020 and 2500 in 2021 to students who met the criteria for the free form,” Mrs Fayemi added.
