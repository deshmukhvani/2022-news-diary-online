She said that the project would support 750 marginalised out of school girls between the age of 10 to 19 years in 10 communities of the FCT, Nasarawa and Niger states to be better informed on GBV. According to her, about 45 per cent of girls don’t even know what GBV is all about, because they don’t know about it does not mean that they don’t suffer it.   `We find out that a good percentage of communities do not support the girls that suffer GBV rather they stigmatise them, that is the major reason why we need to sensitise the communities. “We need to advocate for better support for girls. Our strategies is survivor centered strategy. It is a strategy to build support round the girls, to build a multi central support from the communities.  “The support that will stand for the girls so that when this violence cases come up, the community heads don’t handle it in a careless manner, leaving the girls in pain. “We want to build strong support among those communities, such as traditional leaders, religious, the families’ fathers and mothers at various homes, among others.   “So, when such support is strongly built, it will go a long way to protect the girls and women in the communities,’’ she said.
