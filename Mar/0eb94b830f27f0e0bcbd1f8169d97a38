He also revelead that is a plot to use students,striking university lecturers,labour unions among others for a mass action similar to the #EndSARS protest.  The agency’s statement signed by Afunanya reads: “The Department of State Services (DSS) hereby alerts the public of a sinister plan by some elements to stoke violence in parts of the country particularly the North Central. The aim is to cause ethno-religious crisis, ignite reprisals and heat up the polity. In a bid to achieve this, the sponsors have mobilised foot soldiers and held several meetings in and outside the target areas.  “The Service is also aware of a plot to use students, striking University teachers, labour unions, disgruntled individuals and strategic groups as well as exploit the global energy situation to carry out a mass protest like the #ENDSARS. This is despite ongoing efforts by Government to address the issues.  “While the Service views the machination as unpatriotic, it is on the trail of the agents of destabilisation who are desirous of using violence to achieve ulterior goals. Though it has emplaced measures to disrupt these tendencies, it warns the ring leaders and their cohorts to desist from acts capable of causing a breakdown of law and order.   The DSS spokesman said, “The public should .. rest assured that the Service will, in conjunction with other security agencies, go after the sponsors of this scheme and ensure the law takes it course.  “Citizens are advised not only to engage according to rules but should resist persuasions to be used to destroy their own country. Those who may wish to go contrary to the law will, however, face the consequences”, the statement said.
