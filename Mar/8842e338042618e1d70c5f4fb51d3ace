He said also that Air Peace was excited to serve as a strategic means of fostering the already existing positive relations and further cementing the ties between the two countries through air travel.  “We are determined to reduce the air travel burden of Africans, and this will continue to propel our route expansion as well as fleet modernisation programme. “Air Peace has accomplished so much in just seven years of operation, as we now have a network of 20 domestic routes, seven regional routes and two international destinations.   “The international destinations include Johannesburg, which we launched in December 2020. “Also planned for launch in the future are routes such as Houston-USA, Mumbai-India, Guangzhou-China and London. We’re constantly reviewing our route network in line with the travel needs of Africans,’’ Kamano said.

Kabiru thanked Air Peace for always rescuing Nigerians, citing the airline’s evacuation record and reiterated the commitment of the Nigerian Embassy in Niger to supporting its operations in the neighbouring country.  In February, Air Peace announced plans to kick-off three weekly flights into Niamey from Abuja and Kano.
