By Chimezie Godfrey Popular Nigerian veteran Afro-Pop musician, John Odafe Asiemo, popularly known in the entertainment world as Daddy Showkey, has traced his ability to walk again after he was involved in a ghastly motor accident to the goodwill and assistance of the Minister, Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio. In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Pidgin, which has gone viral, the Delta State born musician, whose brand of music, Afro-Pop, made waves in the late 90s narrated how he was made to walk again through the benevolence of the former Governor of Akwa Ibom State.    In his reaction to a question by the interviewer, on how he managed to foot his medical bills in a foreign land, the Afro-Pop Star said,” if I talk this one now… Godswill Akpabio ehnnn, if anybody like make him talk bad about him. Godswill Akpabio, through his Personal Physician, Dr Essien, helped me. The thing wey Akpabio do for me ehnn..I no fit forget am for my life till I die.” Speaking further, the Veteran Afro-Pop musician stated, ” No matter anything wey dem like to talk about Godswill Akpabio, if not for Akpabio, I for no waka again. Akpabio paid my hospital bills. Even to see am after that, come dey hard me. That is why till today, anytime I see anybody from Akwa Ibom State, because of what Akpabio did for me, I will just say, Akwa Ibom Ado Ok. It would be recalled that late last year, an ICT expert, Mr Destiny Young, had taken to the social media to thank the former Senate Minority Leader, for paying close to N30m for his kidney transplant which came out successful.
