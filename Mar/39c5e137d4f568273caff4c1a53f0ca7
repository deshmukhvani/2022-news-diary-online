The PDP, In a suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/389 2022, also sought a court order deregistering the APC as a political party having failed to meet the requirements of Sections 222(a), 223(b) and 225 of the 1999 Constitution.  The party, in the suit dated March 25 and filed by its counsel, Samuel Irabor, listed the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC), the APC, Registered Trustees of APC and the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee(CECPC).
