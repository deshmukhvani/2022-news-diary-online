VONa Communications has become the largest shareholder at Global Village Extra, thereby necessitating a change of name at the organisation.  The website will hitherto change to voiceofnaija.ng, a shift from globalvillageextra.com, which followers and audience have been accustomed to for the past six years since operation kicked off.  VONa, which derives from Voice Of Naija, is a new dispensation that is also a response to the yearnings of readers for more people-centered contents as well as the need to evolve with the media ecosystem, the management said in a statement on Tuesday.  It added in the statement by its Managing Director, Tay Olayemi: “Rest assured that this change births a new beginning in the annals of journalism practice in Nigeria, and across the globe.  “The management is now open to new partnerships, sponsorships and advert placements. “Welcome to a new dispensation, welcome to the Voice of Naija where your voice is your power.”
