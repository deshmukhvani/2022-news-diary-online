By Okeoghene Akubuike The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), says Nigeria’s headline inflation rate increased to 20.77 per cent on a year-on-year basis in September 2022. This is contained in a statement issued by Prince Semiu Adeniran, the Statistician-General of the Federation and Chief Executive Officer, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday in Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the statement was on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Inflation Report for September. Adeniran said the figure is 4.14 per cent points higher compared to the 16.63 per cent recorded in September 2021. “This indicates that in September 2022, the general price level was 4.14 per cent higher relative to September 2021.” He said factors responsible for the increase in the annual inflation rate include interruption in the supply of food products, increase in import cost due to the persistent currency depreciation and a general increase in the cost of production. Adeniran said on a month-on-month basis, the headline inflation rate in September was 1.36 per cent, which was 0.41 per cent lower than the rate recorded in August 2022 at 1.77 per cent. “This means that in September 2022, the headline inflation rate on a month–on–month basis declined by 0.41 per cent, relative to August 2022.” He said that the factor responsible for the decline in the monthly inflation rate in the last two months was a decline in the changes in the food index. According to him, this is relative to the reference month index, which is due to the present harvest season. He said the percentage change in the average CPI for all items index for the 12 months ending September 2022 over the average of the CPI for the previous 12-month period was 17.43 per cent. ” This is showing a 0.60 per cent increase compared to 16.83 per cent recorded in September 2021.” Adeniran said increases were recorded in all Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP), divisions that yielded the Headline index.
