By Kingsley Okoye Sen.  Chimaroke Nnamani (APC- Enugu East) says APC Presidential Candidate, Sen. Bola  Tinubu is hale and hearty . Nnamani, a foremost Medical Doctor and Surgeon, made the assertion on Monday  in a statement in Abuja.   The former governor of Enugu State  said Tinubu had no health challenge as erroneously being speculated, saying that the former Lagos state governor’s health was  not encumbered in any way . “ I join millions of our people in welcoming Tinubu home. It is to God’s Glory that he returned in superb health. “ I continue to strongly condemn those who wallow in ignorance in celebration of real and fantom infirmities.   ” I lend my voice in celebration of his giant strides in governance, reforms and locality administration in all its spheres. I salute his political deftness and sagacity.” Nnamani said as a medical professional with honour,  he attested to  Tinubu’s good health and capacity. “Tinubu has a robust general system, acute awareness of his holistic environment, political and in all ramifications.   “A bubbling and vivacious personality, his confidence is easily apparent, sharing and transferable, engaging him clearly demonstrates good health, energy and readiness to rumble.” He said his acquaintance with Tinubu over the years was without prejudice to his current political commitments.
