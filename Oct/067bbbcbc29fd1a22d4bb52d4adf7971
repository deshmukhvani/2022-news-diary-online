By Olawunmi Ashafa The market capitalisation of the Nigerian Exchange Ltd (NGX) dropped by N655 billion, following the hike in the nation’s inflation rate to 20.77 per cent. The News of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday announced the inflation rate for September, standing at 20.77 per cent as against 20.5 per cent in August.

The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in Airtel Africa Plc. Similarly, the stock market’s weak performance was driven by selloffs in Airtel Africa, depreciating by 10 per cent. Analysts at United Capital Plc said bargain hunting would continue as investors looked forward to the third quarter ended September, thus cherry-picking stocks with great underlying fundamentals.   “However, we maintain that the broader equities market will remain in a lull pending the release of Q3, 2022 results,” United Capital said.
