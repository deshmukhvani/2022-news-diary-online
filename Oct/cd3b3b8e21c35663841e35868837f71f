By Funmilayo Adeyemi                Osinbanjo said the country was developing a verifiable database of teachers saying that the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) had registered 2, 108, 342 teachers and licensed 1,250,000 teachers.  ” No society can grow beyond its educational attainment. One of the  major differences between healthy, well functioning and  prosperous societies and poorer societies is education. ” We owe so much of our well-being as a nation to our educators at every level.“Indeed our future as a nation  is so heavily dependent on education and our educators. This explains why the Federal government is determined to return teachers, teaching and the teaching profession to their rightful places.  ” To this end we are fully implementing the professional teaching and teacher qualification framework standards that will invariably impact on education outcome and teacher performance at the pre-school, basic, secondary and tertiary levels,” he said. He also said that the new teachers policy was already being implemented at the federal level and in some states.  He, therefore, urged states that have not implemented the policies, to do so immediately, saying the gains were already showing. Also, the Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu, said the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission had completed work on the reviewed renumeration package for teachers in basic and secondary schools.  Adamu said that arrangements had also been concluded to commence the payment of stipends and scholarships to those studying education in universities and colleges of education to boost enrolment. ” The National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission has completed work on the reviewed remuneration package for teachers in basic and secondary schools including provisions for rural posting allowance, science teachers’ allowance and peculiar allowance.   ” Implementation is awaiting conclusion of consultations with state governments and the National Assembly,” he said. Adamu also said the practice of attracting and retaining the best brains in the teaching profession to reduce current shortfalls in staff-students ratios in universities had been restored.  “We have significantly improved teacher quality through steadfast implementation of certification and removal of quacks from our classrooms, through the untiring efforts by the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) and the National Teachers Institute (NTI). ” To mitigate the current dearth of qualified teachers in the school system, government has commenced the implementation of a teacher conversion programme with ICT training, starting with the Federal Civil Service.  ” We are pleased to note that a number of states have also implemented the scheme. ” The Federal Ministry of Education in partnership with other agencies of government has commenced the implementation of welfare programmes approved by President Muhammadu Buhari for teachers.  ” This includes sponsorship to refresher training to benchmark best practices, building low-cost housing in rural areas and the introduction of a specialised pension scheme. ” Similarly, the biological children of teachers can now attend their respective schools at no cost as an additional incentive for committed service and in appreciation of the sacrificial spirit that propels it.  ” We have revamped the curriculum and introduced history and religious knowledge as stand-alone subjects. We are also working with professional associations and religious bodies including the Nigerian Historical Society to address the shortage of teachers in specialised subjects,” he said. A teacher, Mrs Esther Ingbiase, from Federal Government Girls College, Bwari, said she was highly elated to have participated in the 2022 World Teachers Day.  Ingbiase said teachers were eagerly waiting for the commencement of payment for their renumeration as promised by the minister. Meanwhile, Mr Samson Haruna, State Publicity Secretary, NUT FCT wing, however, said that the Federal Government had only implemented 35years in service/65 years for teachers age but awaiting implementation of other packages as promised by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2020.
