The Director expressed optimism that if Tinubu continued in that direction, there would be no complaint or quarrel among the various support groups and victory was sure as everybody would work towards the success of the party in 2023.  “If things continue the way I see it, Tinubu is definitely leading us to victory by the grace of Almighty Allah because you will not hear any quarrel or complaints because everybody is carried along,” Dan’agundi said. He urged party members, especially in the North West, to work hard to ensure the victory of APC presidential and other candidates.  “I want to use this opportunity to call on all APC members to work hard, particularly in the North West where the winning votes will come from, to ensure that Tinubu becomes the next President,” Babba-Dan’agundi said.(NAN)
