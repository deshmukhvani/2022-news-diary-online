By Ismaila Chafe President Muhammadu Buhari will on Monday in Abuja meet with security chiefs to further review and strengthen security network in the country. Malam Garba Shehu, the president’s spokesman made the assertion in a statement he issued on Sunday in Abuja.   Shehu stated that the president was initially scheduled to commission the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) new Technology and Innovation complex.
