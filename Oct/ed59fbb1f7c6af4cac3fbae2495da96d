He said that the one-week study tour which took place from Sept. 20th to 26th, was organised by the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) “This is part of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between UBEC and KOICA. “The MoU was on strengthening the ICT utilisation capability of smart schools’ teachers, improvement of accessibility to high quality teaching and learning contents, and infrastructural assistance to six smart schools.’’   He said that the delegation visited some smart schools in South Korea and discovered that the smart schools being established by the Federal Government were of exceptionally high standards.
