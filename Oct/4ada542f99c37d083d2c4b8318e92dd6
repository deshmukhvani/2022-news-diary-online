By Stanley NwanosikeThe Federal Government on Tuesday donated multi-million naira worth of relief materials to flood victims in some communities in Enugu State.                                        The governor, represented by the Executive Secretary of Enugu SEMA, Mrs Nkechi Eneh, said that the state took the necessary steps concerning the early warnings by NEMA.  He also said that the state government monitored the level of water in rivers within the state before the sudden release of water from the Lado Dam three weeks ago. Ugwuanyi said that the state lost one person, while at least 30,000 persons were directly affected by the floods.  He said that the disaster affected most communities in Uzo Uwani Local Government Area and other boundary communities in the area. He said: “The state government had relocated all persons in the affected communities to holding camps. “It has also provided some relief items and daily food to the camps.”  The governor further said that the government planned to continue to care for the communities until the flood water had receded. “We will find means of getting these relief materials from NEMA to them and ensure that they would definitely get to the affected persons within a very short time,” he said.
