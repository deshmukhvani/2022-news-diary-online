The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Supreme Court on Friday affirmed Oborevwori as the governorship candidate of PDP in Delta. At the PDP primary in May, Oborevwori polled 590 votes to beat David Edevbie, who polled 113 votes.   However, Edevbie, aggrieved by the outcome of the primary had filed a suit against Oborevwori and the party, citing discrepancies in Oborevwori’s certificates.(NAN)
