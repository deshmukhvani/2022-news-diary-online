By Emmanuel Oloniruha The former National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Uche Secondus has commiserated with  a former senate president, Sen. David Mark on the death of his first Son, Tunde Mark. Secondus, who is also the National Technical Adviser to the PDP National Campaign Council in a statement in Abuja on Friday,  described his death as a huge loss.   He regretted that the death came too early to such a  resourceful and hardworking youngman but God his creator knew  best and could not be questioned.
