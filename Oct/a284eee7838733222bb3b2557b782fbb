Abdulkadir said as part of commitment to manpower development in the hospitality industry, plans were underway to establish a ‘Hospitality Academy’ in Nigeria. He said this would be done in collaboration with the Federal Government to train Nigerian youths in various hospitality skill sets.  “This initiative is borne out of the current global shortage of trained and experienced hospitality manpower. “Indeed, statistics showed that there are currently more than one million job vacancies in housekeeping, waiters, chefs, security, IT and maintenance of the hospitality industry.  “The CHP Hospitality Academy will not only train Nigerians for local employment but will also equip them with the requisite expertise to seek overseas placements to fill the large volume of vacancies in other parts of the world. “Thereby becoming a veritable recourse in the quest to reduce unemployment in Nigeria,’’ he said.
