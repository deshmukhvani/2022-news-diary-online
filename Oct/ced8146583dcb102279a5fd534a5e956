This is highly commendable and I implore the team to do more. “We are so impressed with your performance and I know many Nigerians will still do well to appreciate you more. Just remain focused,” he told the team. RSDF has now supported the team with a total of N3.8 million – N1.7 million during the qualifier and now N2.1 million. The Foundation also promised to increase the amount to N3 million when they make it to the final. The Flamingoes defeated their United States counterparts 4-3 on penalties after 1 – 1 full and extra time score. Both teams gave their all with the Flamingos holding on during the encounter despite the superior tactical play by the Americans. It is Nigeria’s first appearance in the semi-final of the competition. Also, no African women team has ever attained such heights.
