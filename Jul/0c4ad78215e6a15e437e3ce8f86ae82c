But for us, as the saying goes, the reward for hard work is more work, and that is why we are giving you more work. “The position is that of trust. Our masters are the people of Oyo State and our responsibility is to continue to serve them to the best of our abilities and deliver good governance to them.   “Let me encourage you to put the interest of the people of Oyo State first. You will continue to supervise the Housing Corporation even from this position. Also, the Oyo State Road Maintenance Agency, OYSTROMA, will be under your direct supervision. “Finally, you have operated as the Attorney-General of this state before. So, the Ministry of Justice will also be under your watch.   “Our people expect so much from us because to whom much is given, much is expected. This is the campaign season but here in Oyo State, we will continue to work for the good of our people throughout this season.” The governor added that the administration is looking forward to benefiting from the wealth of wisdom and experience of the new deputy governor, so that together, they could continue the task of moving Oyo State people from poverty to prosperity.   “We look forward to benefiting from your wealth of wisdom and experience.

My debt of gratitude is limitless. “As you have witnessed this happen, I did not notice he was monitoring my activities as the chairman of the Housing Corporation, but it was manifested today.” He vowed not to abuse the privilege given to him as Deputy Governor, as according to him, the position of the Deputy Governor is meant to advise and assist the governor of the state and a trust to the constitution and the governor of the state.   “This is a challenge to me as a person and to all of us in Oyo State to cooperate, with the view of moving the government forward in all ramifications. “We are already entering the campaign season but jumping into the season is not enough, we have to trace back to the last three years and see what has been achieved.   “So, this is what I have come on board to complement the already established achievements provided by this administration,” Lawal added.
