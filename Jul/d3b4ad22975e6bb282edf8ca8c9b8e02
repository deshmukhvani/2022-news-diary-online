The News Agency of Nigeria ( NAN) reports that families of the victims led a peaceful protest to the ministry demanding the release of their loved ones on Monday. “The government has not been sleeping from the enquiries I have made. There are some things you do not say in public, but I want you to give me time.  ”Let me resume properly in this office and I promise you, this will be the first issue I am going to tackle by the grace of God,” the Minister assured. The minister then requested for details of contacts, names, addresses and telephone numbers that he could reach them with.  He promised that he would be in constant engagement until every single person in captivity regained freedom and was reunited with their families.
