The Senate President said the ninth National Assembly would continue to work assiduously and collaborate with other arms of government towards stabilising the security and economy of the country to the relief of all Nigerians.   “Since the inauguration of the ninth Assembly in 2019, we have enacted quality legislations to improve the security situation and boost the economy. “We have also taken a second look at extant legislations that require amendment to bring them up to date with current realities, with the overall objective of getting a better deal for the Nigerian people.   “We know that more needs to be done to overcome the challenges. The government is not relenting at addressing the challenges and we are confident that they will soon become history. “As we approach another election year, I earnestly urge Nigerians to look to the future with hope. We will continue to play our roles as a government and count on the prayers and support of the people,” Lawan said.(NAN)
