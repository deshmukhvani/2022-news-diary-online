According to him, I came out as early as 7.00 a.m to cast my vote for my preferred candidate. Benjamin, who claimed to be voting since 1952, said that he also came out to vote for a better economy. “I am 95 years of age and I had been voting since 1952. I still have faith in this country.   “I am here to exercise my civic responsibility and to vote for my candidate for better dividend of democracy,” he said. Benjamin, however, appealed to candidates in the election not to see the election as a do-or-die affair. “Politics is a game and not a fight. No matter what the outcome of the election might be, the winner and the looser should see themselves as one,” he said.   Benjamin commended INEC for the timely arrival of their officials at the polling unit.
