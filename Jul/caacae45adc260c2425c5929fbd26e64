Alabi advised the people of the local government that have registered for PVC to endeavour to collect the cards from the INEC office.

Alabi cautioned the electorate that INEC would detect any multiple registrations and culprit would be prosecuted in accordance with the law. He also appealed to the youths in the local government to shun all forms of violence and refused to be used as political thugs during the 2023 elections.  “I also appeal to our teeming youths in the local government not to sell their PVC to anybody, your PVC is your weapon to vote for a candidate of your choice,” Alabi added. He assured his constituents of quality representation if elected to the state legislature. (NAN)
