The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Re-opening a Bond issue refers to  issuing additional amounts of a previously issued Bond. Re-opened Bonds have the same maturity date and interest rate as the original bonds, but they are sold on different dates and usually at a different price. The DMO, however, said that the calendar was provisional and could be subject to change at short notice. (NAN)
