It said that the governor urged  the guards to concentrate fully on their training as the task ahead of them was enormous and daunting.   “As Community Protection Guards, yours is a patriotic call, your names would stand out in history as people with remarkable patriotism, selflessness and love for peace. “Only people with courage and bravery will offer to serve as guards of their communities, bravely standing up to face the brutal infamy of the bandits,” Matawalle said.  The governor also called on them to work within the parameters of the rules of engagement which would be clearly spelt out during the training. He counseled them as newly-recruited guards, to serve as agents for the restoration of normalcy and peace in their communities.
