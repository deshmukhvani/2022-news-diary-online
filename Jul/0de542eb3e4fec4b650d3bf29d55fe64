By Femi Kasali The Super Falcons recorded a 4-0 win over debutants, Burundi in the last Group C match to finish the Group Phase as runners-up to the Bayana Bayana of South Africa. With the victory, Nigeria finished with Six Points following their wins against Botswana and Burundi, and will face the Indomitable Lioness of Cameroon in the Quarter Finals of the Championship.

This however paid off as the Super Falcons took the lead in the 25th Minute from the Penalty Spot through Rasheedat Ajibade who was fouled by the Burundian Goalkeeper, before Kanu and Efih adding to the tally to give Nigeria a 3-0 lead going into the half time break.
