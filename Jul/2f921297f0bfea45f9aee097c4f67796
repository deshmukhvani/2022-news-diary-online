By Folasade AkpanThe Director-General, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig.-Gen. Muhammad Fadah and its management have commiserated with the family of Miss Eunice Igweike, prospective corps member slain in Ogun State. The commiseration is contained in a statement issued on Saturday in Abuja by the Director, Press and Public Relations, Mr Eddy Megwa.  Megwa said Igweike set out for NYSC permanent orientation camp in Sagamu, Ogun state from Abia, having been deployed to the state for National Service under 2022 Batch ‘B’ Service Year. ”A call by her elder brother to the NYSC on July 20, reporting that he had not been able to reach her on phone since her departure to NYSC Ogun camp from Aba, prompted the scheme to contact the security agencies to know her whereabouts.  ”Sadly, on July 21, her remains which were intact and not mutilated as reported in the media were recovered along Sagamu-Imota Road and deposited in the morgue. ”Security agencies are working round the clock to unravel the circumstances surrounding the death of Igweike”, he said. Megwa also extended the scheme’s condolences to the Ohafia Community, the government and people of Abia state over the death of Igweike.  According to Megwa, the NYSC feels highly diminished by the death of Igweike, a promising young Nigerian that would have been a great ambassador of her family, contributing her quota to nation building.He prayed for the peaceful rest for her soul.
