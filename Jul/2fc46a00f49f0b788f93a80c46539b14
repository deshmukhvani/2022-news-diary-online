That is where we are today, I , Hon. Moshood Salvador and my teeming members of CF, we have moved to LP. “Having moved to LP, we have been doing a lot of things together, that is why we have come to show the whole world that we are no more in APC.   “Our members have been given recognition in LP, such that some of them have become the candidates of the party,” he added.
