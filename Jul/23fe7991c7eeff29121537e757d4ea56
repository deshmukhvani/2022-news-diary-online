The statement also said that the operation would enhance the corps visibility and capability on the nation’s road corridors to ensure reduction in accidents. It said pursuant to the vision of the Nigeria Road Safety Strategy (NRSS) by ensuring that accidents result in no death, FRSC would enforce strict traffic laws.  The corps warned against excessive speeding, driving under the influence of illicit drugs/alcohol or other intoxicating substances. It also cautioned motorists on dangerous driving/overtaking, lane indiscipline/route violation, road obstruction, use of cellpone while driving and overloading, among others.  The command advised traders, hawkers and motor park operators that could be in the habit of allowing their businesses to interfere with traffic flow to find safer places to operate.

The command called on the public to call the FRSC toll free emergency number 122 to report accidents, obstructions or other emergencies and adhere to COVID-19 pandemic protocols.(NAN)
