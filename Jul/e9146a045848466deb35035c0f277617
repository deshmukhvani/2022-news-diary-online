Abakpa told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that no soldier was missing in action or abducted by the terrorists, adding that the casualties had been evacuated. He also said that the troops had dislodged the criminals from the area and had continued on exploitation operation into the area. He said “no soldier was abducted; we only had three casualties and they were evacuated”. Intelligence reports had confirmed that the terrorists were planning to attack Law School Bwari and other government facilities. However, military sources have told NAN that the attack was a confirmation of terrorists plan to lay siege on FCT, adding that the security agencies were at alert. Earlier on Monday, the Guards spokesperson confirmed that troops of 7 Guards Battalion on routine patrol along Kubwa – Bwari road were ambushed by suspected terrorists.
