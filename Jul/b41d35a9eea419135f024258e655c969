Obi urged Nigerians not to give up on the country, but renew their zeal in working toward building a new and more productive nation for all. “We have no other nation but Nigeria, and we must not let it collapse. Let us now break the barriers of religion that divide us, and unite to take back our nation for progress and development,” he said. (NAN)
