He said his hobbies were gisting, sleeping and partying.“I am going to be real as much as possible, spontaneous, unpredictable and will be a lover boy,” he said. Another new housemate, Modella from Osun described herself as the content queen the house needed.  “I am special because I am  multi-talented and a content creator which makes me stand out anywhere I go, I am fun to be with. “On the scale of 100, I am 100 per cent excited to be here on the show, I will be bringing in lots of energy and vibes,” she said.
