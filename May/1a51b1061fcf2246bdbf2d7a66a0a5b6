This will also make the social life of every Nigerian much more meaningful as you will rescue Nigeria from bottom to top.” Governor Ortom who said “the presidential nomination exercise was credible and transparent,” also commended all the other presidential aspirants, especially Governor Nyesom Wike for “exhibiting courage, patriotism and extraordinary spirit of sportsmanship which they displayed throughout their campaigns across the country leading to the National Convention.”   He then stressed the need for all patriotic members of the party to unite and ensure the success of the party in all forthcoming elections because the unity and supremacy of our party must be respected.
