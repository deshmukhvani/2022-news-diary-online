Responding, the Chairman, PDP in Bauchi State, Alhaji Hamza Akuyam, said out of all the presidential aspirants that visited the state to meet with the party’s delegates, none was received in the way and manner Abubakar was received. “Since it was an instruction from the governor that we receive him (Atiku) in the government house, we will give him all what we are going to give to the governor himself,” he said.
