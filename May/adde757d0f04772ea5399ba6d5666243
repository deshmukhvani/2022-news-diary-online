Mr Ademola Oyede, also contesting for Eti-Osa Constituency 1, told NAN that logistics involved in mobilising electoral officers and others contributed to the delay in starting the primary election. “We also have to put into consideration, Lagos traffic; also,  yesterday, there was a downpour in the state.  “Whenever we start the process, we are confident that  chosen contestants will reflect the  will of the people,” Oyede said.
