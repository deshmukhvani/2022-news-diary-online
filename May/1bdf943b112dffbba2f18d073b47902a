By Oluwatope Lawanson Sen. Bola Tinubu, a Presidential Aspirant of the   All Progressives Congress (APC) has commiserated with the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike , over last Saturday’s stampede at a church programme in Port Harcourt. Tinubu in a condolence message signed by him on Monday in Lagos, also expressed his condolences to  the  Rivers people over the incident that killed 30 persons.  “I offer my sincere condolences to the governor, the good people of Rivers State and to the bereaved families, friends and loved ones of all those who sadly perished in the recent catastrophic stampede in Port Harcourt. “This was a devastating and unfortunate disaster, which took place in the cruelest of circumstances – at an event organised by a local church to provide food, clothing and spiritual guidance to the needy.  “My thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those who sadly lost their lives and with the innocent survivors now forced to rebuild their lives in the aftermath of this terrible incident.” Tinubu prayed that God Almighty guide, guard and keep all those who survived the stampede as they begin the process of healing, recovery and peace.  “I also beseech Almighty Allah to grant your administration, as well as all others around the country, the fortitude and wisdom necessary to implement measures, policies and guidelines to ensure that nothing like this happens again in Rivers, or anywhere else in Nigeria,” he said. Tinubu also commended the state’s police command, men and women of Rivers’ emergency management agencies for their diligence, professionalism and quick response to the disaster.  “As leaders, we must do all that we can to protect the lives of our citizens “I offer you my support in this time of grief. It is important that we learn the lessons of this incident and make sure nothing like this ever happens again.” (NAN)
