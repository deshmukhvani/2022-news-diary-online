Meanwhile, another participant, Miss Gloria Ayeni described the programme as apt. “This class is like nothing I have ever been to before; I have been to many entrepreneurship workshops; but, this is one that has been very different and very insightful.   “Paul spoke in a way I have never heard anybody speak about creativity and entrepreneurship,” Ayeni said.
