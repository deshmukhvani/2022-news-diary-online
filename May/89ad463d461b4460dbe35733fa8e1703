The COAS, who was on routine operational visit to the JTF OPHK to assess the level of successes recorded thus far, called on troops to be more decisive in routing the criminal elements from their enclaves.  Gen Yahaya arrived the theatre of operations in company of some principal staff officers, where he was given an update on the ongoing Operation DESERT SANITY and Operation LAKE SANITY. He expressed satisfaction with the successes so far, urging them to remain vigilant and proactive during the Eid-el-Fitr Celebration.  General Yahaya enjoined troops to continue to decimate the insurgents, and deny them freedom of action.
