I should say that it is a welcome development, the players are good individually.  “We need this type of win for the team to boost the confidence of the players; we can see that we have different goal scorers in the game as well. “The win will surely send a message to other teams about the Eagles because every of the players performed well and it is difficult to single a player out for credit.  “We are happy that we are getting the results and so far so good things are getting in shape,” he said. Dikko also said that the newly employed Portuguese Super Eagles coach, Jose Pesseiro, had instilled new developments into the team for the positive results.  “The Super Eagles coach is performing well so far, he is stabilising the team, bringing the desired competition and discipline in the team. “The coach is sound tactically and also brilliant, taking things one step at a time.
