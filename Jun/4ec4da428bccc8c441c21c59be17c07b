The Nigerian leader, who commended the level of professionalism of Nigerians living in Rwanda and the amiable nature of their interactions with each other, added that living peacefully and in obedience to the laws of the host nation was also paramount as it gives Nigeria a good name. ‘‘Remember, that you are our ambassadors-at-large while here. People would read and know Nigeria by your actions and activities. ‘‘Our government is determined to work with Nigerians both at home and abroad to develop our economy and create a nation that is productive, peaceful, and caters to the needs of its citizens. ‘‘We are also working assiduously to protect all Nigerians whether at home or abroad to feel safe and attain their full potentials in life.’’ President Buhari noted that with the establishment of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Nigerians abroad can now seamlessly contribute their quota to national development, especially in the areas of investments in the economy. ‘‘Our agriculture, housing and real estate, ICT, healthcare, education and services sectors among others are waiting for your inputs and investments considering your global exposure. ‘‘Let me urge you to key into the programmes of NIDCOM to make your contributions,’’ he said, adding that they should continue to uphold the good image of Nigeria by obeying the laws of their host country. The Nigerian High Commissioner to Rwanda, Ambassador Aishatu Musa, told President Buhari that Nigerians in the country were generally well behaved, and their population has swelled from 100 to 400 in recent years, “and they are in various fields like banking, agriculture, education, telecommunications, and others.” She added that President of the Association of Nigerians was Professor Umaru Wali, a Dean at the University of Rwanda, who hails from Sokoto State.
