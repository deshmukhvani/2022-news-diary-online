By Femi Kasali For the second time in Nine Years, the marriage of multi-award winning Nollywood Actress, Funke Akindele Bello has crashed. In 2013, Akindele’s fairytale marriage to property mogul, Kehinde Oloyede-Almaroof hit the rock. Nice years later, his marriage to Abdulrasheed Bello, popularly known as JJC Skillz has also hit the rock. Before now, the media has been awash with the issues of the couple leading to their separation, but they hid this away from public glare. However, the separation of the duo has been made public following the post of JJC Skillz on his Instagram page on Thursday, June 30, 2022, JJC Skillz said he moved out of the house three months ago and they had been leading separate lives. He said, “Dear Friends and family, I need to let you know that Funke and I have separated. While it lasted we shared a lot of things together and have created 2 beautiful children. “The last two years have been extremely difficult for us. I know I have tried my best to fix things but I believe it is beyond repair now. Three months ago and at Funke’s insistence, I moved out of the house and apart from AMVCA have not been able to get Funke to sit down in an amicable manner to discuss the future of our relationship. “I’m making this announcement so that the public is clear that we both are pursuing separate lives. We still have issues that need to be addressed such as the custody and wellbeing of our children which is paramount as well as business interests which need to be disentangled but I have no doubt that these will be resolved one way or the other.”
