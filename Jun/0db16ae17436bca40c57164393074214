According to the president, Queen Elizabeth II is the first British monarch to reach seven decades on the throne.

Their firm belief is that she always has the potential to deliver, especially during troubled times. ”It is confirmation of the fact that Queen Elizabeth always acts and delivers according to people’s expectations.   “In her lonely journey on the throne, and so recently having lost her husband and principal supporter Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, I and all our citizens wish her many more years as Queen of England and Head of the Commonwealth, in excellent condition of health”.
