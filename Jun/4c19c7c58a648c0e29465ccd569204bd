By Thompson Yamput The Chairman of Kabba-Bunu Local Government of Kogi, Mr Moses Olorunleke, has declared Thursday for fasting and prayers for peace to return to  the area. In a statement issued on Wednesday in Kabba, the chairman said that the Obaro of Kabba, Oba Solomon Dele-Owoniyi, had approved the declaration. According to the chairman, all shops and offices are to remain closed throughout the day for the fasting and prayers.  He said that the fasting and prayers became imperative in view of the insecurity in the area in recent times. The chairman observed that the security situation was worsened by two explosions that occurred in the area within two weeks. “The first explosion occurred on May 11, while another occurred on May 29.  “It is a serious development that calls for drastic and spiritual measures, hence the declaration of Thursday (June 16) as a day for solemn assembly in the area,” Olorunleke said. He called on both Muslims and Christians residents of the area to pray to God to restore peace to the once peaceful area “Of course, without peace there can never be any development in our area.  “I hereby appeal to those causing trouble in the area to kindly leave the good citizens of Kabba-Bunu alone,” he pleaded. On May 30,  the chairman directed that beer parlours in Kabba town must close shop at 7 p.m. daily following the explosion. Olorunleke also directed commercial motorcyclists to stop operations from 10 p.m. indefinitely from May 31.  In the first explosion 16 persons were affected while two persons died while in the second explosion, 11 persons were affected and one person died. Kogi Police Command Public Relations Officer William Ovye-Aya, confirmed knowledge of the chairman’s declaration.  He said that the command’s officers and men were ready to offer adequate security for the people of the area to ensure the success of the fasting and prayers.(NAN)
