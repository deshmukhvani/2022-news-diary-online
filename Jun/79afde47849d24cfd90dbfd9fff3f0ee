And by extension since Governor Seyi Makinde appointed him, why is Oyo State government deceiving the people?“You asked us to come and collect $200 each so that we can be able to feed and move around, we did so in the interest of peace.“Why will you now lie to the public that you are no longer owing any of the aggrieved pilgrims.“What manner of a Professor is Malik? He has no fear of Allah at all and it is only Allah that will judge him and Governor Makinde that has refused to call him to order.“And who knows if the state government has diverted the money as we are hearing in some quarters.” Meanwhile, after spending seven days, the first batch of 250 pilgrims left Madinah Sunday afternoon for Mecca.
