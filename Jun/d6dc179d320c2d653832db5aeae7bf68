Speaking earlier, the Vice Chancellor commended the minister for his unrelenting efforts at reforming the power sector. He said the institution had been out of power supply since 2020 due to the insurgency.  ‘The university has been on generators which takes a huge sum of its funding, ”The generators, in spite consuming huge sum of its funds do not  provide the needed electricity for the university operations.”  He appealed to the  minister to ensure that power supply was restored to the institution with a  promise that all power projects within its premises would be secured.
