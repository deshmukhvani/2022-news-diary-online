Liverpool have confirmed the departure of seven players, including striker Divock Origi, when their contracts expire at the end of this month. Goalkeeper Loris Karius and former first-team players Sheyi Ojo and Ben Woodburn have also been released, along with three members of the club’s academy. Origi spent eight years on Merseyside and sealed the Reds’ stunning second leg comeback to sink FC Barcelona 4-3 on aggregate in the UEFA Champions League semi-final in 2019. Announcing the Belgian’s departure, Liverpool wrote: “Divock Origi will leave the club when his contract expires at the end of June. “Thank you for an incredible eight years of service and leaving us with so many special memories. @DivockOrigi, Liverpool legend”. Karius became notorious for his error-strewn performance in the 2018 UEFA Champions League final against Real Madrid, and spent much of his subsequent Anfield career on loan. Ojo made 13 senior appearances, scoring in the FA Cup win over Exeter. Woodburn became the club’s youngest goalscorer — a title he still holds — when he scored in the League Cup match against Leeds United at the age of 17.(dpa/NAN)
