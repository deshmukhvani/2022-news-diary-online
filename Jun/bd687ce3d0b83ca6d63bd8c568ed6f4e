The theme for CHOGM 2022 is ‘Delivering a Common Future: Connecting, Innovating, Transforming,’  and the Heads of Government are expected to reaffirm their commitment to upholding the Commonwealth Charter, which focuses on democracy, human rights, the rule of law, as well as economic opportunities and sustainable development.
