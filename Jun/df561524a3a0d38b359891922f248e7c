Dr. Ruqayyah Aliyu of Information and Media Studies of Bayero University, Kano and Ibrahim Muhammad Machina of Federal University Gashua presented papers of the role of youth in peace building. Ruqayya who discussed the Roles of Youths in Peace Building From Communication Perspective said youths play active roles in conflict and peace building situations due to their agility and activeness. She urged Nigerians youths to desist from hate speech and use social media positively to promote peace and development. “Social media can facilitate peace by encouraging valuable dialogue between people from different ethnic, religious, and political backgrounds.” “The country is in a critical time and we need to be mindful of the things we say. Words are powerful; they can build or destroy a nation,” she said.
