The president of the  council, Mr  Henry Yunkwap, expressed the organisation’s condolences while addressing  newsmen on Monday in Jos.  “I want to categorically state here again that as believers in Christ Jesus, we are called to be peace loving people and to preach it with both words and actions. “On behalf of the entire Catholic Laity in Nigeria, we sympathise with the bishop, priests and the Laity of Ondo Diocese over this act.  “Our hearts are with you. We pray for the departed souls and quick recovery to the injured,” he said. The organisation’s president stressed that “every life is sacred and nobody has the right to take it in whatever way, under any guise.  “Their killers should be arrested and dealt with according to the laws of the land”.(NAN)
