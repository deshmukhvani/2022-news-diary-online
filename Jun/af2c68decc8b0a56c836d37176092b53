He said the ministry was resolute in ensuring that women had a safe pregnancy and delivery services. “April 11, was set aside as the Global Safe Motherhood Day, so we will use this forum to join in commemorating safe motherhood. ”Safe motherhood arose from the concerted effort of the pregnant woman, her family, the community and health personnel at all levels of care, to ensure the safety of mothers during pregnancy, delivery and afterwards.  “By this definition, all members of society play a role. We know that a major factor in maternal mortality is the delay in reaching a health facility. “The National Emergency Medical Service and Ambulance System (NEMSAS) will be launched and piloted in FCT, to mitigate barriers and facilitate prompt access for patients in need of urgent medical attention without the demand for payment at the point of care. “This service will be expanded to other states to make it available to pregnant women in Nigeria,” he said.
