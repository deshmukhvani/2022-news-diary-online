She noted that the trip was hugely successful as Nigeria also won the position of the AACT Trustee for the West & Central Africa.   “We remain grateful to God for these positive achievements and look forward to more wins for Nigeria in future. Together we move,” she said. Team Nigeria finished 9th position at the 2018 edition of the AACT held at the Achimota Golf Club in Ghana.
