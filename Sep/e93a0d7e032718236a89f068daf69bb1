That is why I decided that me Sen. Walid Jibril, I am stepping down from the BoT. “I discussed this with the candidate and he agreed with me. If the party wins I will be given a bigger position,” Jibril said.   The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the former President of the Senate, Sen.

He asked all NEC members for a standing ovation for Jibrin. On his part, Abubakar appreciated Jibrin’s sense of patriotism and services to the party, while Wabara said that Jibrin by his action had demonstrated that BOT is truly the conscience of the PDP.
