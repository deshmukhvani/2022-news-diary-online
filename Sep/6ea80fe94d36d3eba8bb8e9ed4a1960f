According to the statement, Fayemi, in his acceptance speech, described the victory as “a burden of history”. “Leadership isn’t just a title, but an instrument that should be used to influence policies that would impact positively on the people. “It is time Africans stopped agonising and start organising.   “The forum will work assiduously to promote the vision of deepening decentralisation and devolution for the material benefit of African people,” Fayemi was quoted as saying. Fayemi, who is also the Chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum, pledged to use his office to strengthen the quest for African integration through the promotion of African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the SDGs 2030.   He thanked his colleagues in the forum for the honour, reiterating that all present must exhibit the desire to work in tandem with the Africa Union (AU) agenda.
