The command’s spokesman explained that on their way back to the Police Station, the two suspects jumped out of the moving Police Hilux vehicle in an attempt to escape adding that the police went after them.   “In a bid to demobilise them, they were maimed by the operatives, and rearrested. The suspects gave up the ghost while they were being taken to the hospital,” he said. Edafe said that a manhunt for the other fleeing members of the gang is ongoing. (NAN)
