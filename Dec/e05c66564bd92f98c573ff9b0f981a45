Buhari in a tribute to the football legend on behalf of all Nigerians, said: “May he rest in peace. He led a good life and made a huge contribution to the development of global football in particular and world sport in general.   “He had an enormous generousity of spirit and humility in spite his greatness as a footballer and sportsman. ”He also built bridges across nations, races and even religions. He was a UN Ambassador of goodwill. Pele is gone but the world will never forget him. RIP. “ (NAN)
