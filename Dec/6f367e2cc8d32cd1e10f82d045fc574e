By Christian Ogbonna Traditional Rulers in Ebonyi on Wednesday kicked against any individual opposing Gov. David Umahi’s 2023 senatorial race, declaring that such person or candidate may not see the next Christmas. Chief Charles Mkpuma, Chairman, South-East Traditional Rulers Council, made the pronouncement in Uburu, Ohaozara local government area (LGA) of Ebonyi during the official inauguration of Umahi’s Senatorial campaign activities for 2023 elections.

He assured his constituents and the entire State of quality representation, inclusiveness and a pride of place in the affairs of the country. “I am going to the centre to fight for the welfare of Ebonyi people; employment, infrastructure. I am going to fight for the empowerment of Ebonyi people and we will take it by force,” he stated.   The Governor charged constituents to also throw their support behind the APC Gubernatorial Candidate, Mr Francis Nwifuru. (NAN)
