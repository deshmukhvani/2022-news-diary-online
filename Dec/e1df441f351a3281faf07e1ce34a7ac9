Soludo, who expressed his condolences in a statement signed by Mr Christian Aburime, his Press Secretary, said Obiozor was a great diplomat and a solid intellectual in the diplomatic circles.   He described the passing on as a big loss to the people of Imo State, Igbo race, the Nigerian nation and the world at large. Soludo noted that as a professor and diplomat who was the Nigerian Ambassador to the United States at a time, Obiozor truly impacted the world around him as a leader and would therefore be solely missed.   “On behalf of my family, the government and good people of Anambra State, I commiserate with the Obiozor’s family and the government of Imo State over the irreparable loss,” he stated.
