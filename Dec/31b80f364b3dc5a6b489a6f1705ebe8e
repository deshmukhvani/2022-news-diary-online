By Maureen Ojinaka The National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) on Tuesday swore in 1,210 corps members of the 2022 Batch ‘C’ Stream 2 set, deployed to Enugu for the one-year mandatory national service.  The Acting Director General, Mrs Christy Uba, gave the number during the swearing in ceremony at the NYSC Orientation Camp, Awgu Local Government Area, Enugu.  Uba, who was represented by the NYSC State Coordinator, Mr Sam Ujogu, said that the corps members comprised 449 males and 761 females. She urged the newly-sworn in corps members to always promote the unity and integration of the country.  “Your deployment to the state will not only offer you the opportunity for a broader understanding of the country. It will also entrench the culture of working together in an atmosphere filled with friendship, peace, harmony and shared vision of a great and prosperous Nigeria,” she said. Uba implored them to sustain the high level of discipline and enthusiasm they had demonstrated so far.  She encouraged them to avail themselves of the opportunities for self-employment offered through the skill acquisition entrepreneurship development programme, which starts at the orientation camp.  She urged the corps members to participate in all the camp activities as it was an avenue that provided them the opportunity to realise their potentials and attain individual feat during and after the service year.  Administering the oath of allegiance to the corps members earlier, the Enugu State Chief Judge, Justice Raymond Ozoemena, who was represented by Justice Anthony Onovo, urged the corps members to be law-abiding during and after the service year.  Ozoemena urged them to detest, shun bribery and all forms of corruption as the oath they took was very important. (NAN)
