By Taiye Agbaje Three civil society organisations (CSOs) have dragged the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to court over alleged failure to furnish them with its 2020 Budget breakdown in line with the provisions of the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act. The CSOs; Foundation for Environmental Rights, Advocacy & Development (FENRAD), Social Development Integrated Centre (Social Action) and Abia State NDDC Advocacy groups, filed the suit at the Federal High Court (FHC), Umuahia in Abia.   The Executive Director of FENRAD, Mr Nelson Nwafor, stated this on behalf of others in a statement he signed and made available to newsmen on Monday in Abuja. He said in the suit marked: FHC/UMU/CS/349/2022 dated Dec  22 and filed by their lawyer, J.C.Anyigor, the CSOs are praying the court to compel the NDDC to make available details of the 2020 Budget and procurement made within the period to them in compliance with FoI Act.   He said the groups want the commission to make available to them details of the vendors used in the procurement process, details of the bidding process, details of the contractors who executive the projects, details of the executed projects/location of the projects budgeted as well as the process of the disbursement to the contractors. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the suit, which was filed via a motion ex-parte, was brought in pursuant to Order 34, Rules 3(1) & (2) of the FHC (Civil Procedure) Rules 2019 and under the inherent jurisdiction of the honorable court for Judicial Review.   They said the request was made in compliance with the provisions of the FOI Act which entitles citizens, groups the right to request information from government institutions, individuals and corporate organisations.(NAN)
