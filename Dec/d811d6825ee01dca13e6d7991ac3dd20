Oyebanji in a condolence message signed by his Special Adviser (Media), Yinka Oyebode, described the late matriarch of the Adesina family as a “loving and prayerful mother”.   “She also instilled in her children the virtues of hard work, integrity and dedication to duty,” the governor said.

She has gone to have a well-deserved rest. “I urge my brother and the entire family to take solace in the fact that she lived a remarkable life of impact and left behind excellent children and a good name.   “On behalf of my wife, the Government and the good people of Ekiti State, I commiserate with Dr Adesina and the entire family and pray that God grants them the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss and grant mama eternal rest.” he said.
