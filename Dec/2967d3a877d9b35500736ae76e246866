Makinde assured the people of the state that he would remain truthful to them, if given the opportunity to return to Agodi Government House.   According to him, his administration has been maintaining the policy instituted on the use of Hijab in the public schools of Oyo State by the previous administration in the state. He maintained that his government has been unbiased and impartial in the appointment of political office holders, such as commissioners and political aides, saying both major religions were equitably represented.   He charged the electorate to cast their votes based on merit, saying that there won’t be any room for those that want to divide the people through religion.

They charged him to be unbiased, just and be more diplomatic in handling religious issues. (NAN)
