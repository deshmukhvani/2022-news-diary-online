My mother was a virtuous woman, who cared for everyone. “Those who knew her will attest to what am saying, her love for humanity knew no bound.   “These items are my little contribution to honour her because during her life time, this was what she did best, ”  Nwoko said. NAN reports that top military personnel, technocrats and captains of industry paid tribute to the late mother of the army general.   At the funeral service held at Mount Zion Baptist Church, Idumuje-Ugboko, the officiating priest, Rev.

It is only in death that we can see God.   “Mama has finished her race, she has gone to meet her God. Tomorow, it can be you or myself. No one knows the hour”, Okoh said.(NAN)
