I am told he has a wife and two siblings, and more painful, no kids yet.  “We will give the wife and siblings necessary support going forward. You can count on us. I pray Almighty God to grant the family the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss,” Niboro quoted Omo-Agege as saying. Niboro said that Pastor Friday Mala while speaking on behalf of the family thanked Omo-Agege for coming personally to commiserate with the family instead of sending a delegation.  “In spite of the circumstances, the family prays that Omo-Agege emerged victorious at the polls,” Mala said. Recall that the boat mishap occurred when the APC campaign team was returning home from campaign rallies at Ugborodo/Okerenkoko, Warri South- West Local Government Area of the state.(NAN)
