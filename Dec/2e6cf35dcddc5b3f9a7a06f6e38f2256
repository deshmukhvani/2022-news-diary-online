By Bridget Ikyado Former Pope Benedict XVI has died at his Vatican residence, aged 95, almost a decade after he stood down because of ailing health. He led the Catholic Church for less than eight years until, in 2013, he became the first Pope to resign since Gregory XII in 1415.   Benedict spent his final years at the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery within the walls of the Vatican. This is contained in a statement from the nigeriacatholicnetwork.com via Vatican News, made available through Padre Mike  Umoh, the National Director of Social Communications in Abuja on Saturday.   His successor, Pope Francis said he had visited him there frequently. The Vatican said in a statement: “With sorrow I inform you that the Pope Emeritus, Benedict XVI, passed away today at 9:34 in the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery in the Vatican. “Further information will be provided as soon as possible.”   The Vatican said the body of the Pope Emeritus would be placed in St. Peter’s Basilica from Monday for “the greeting of the faithful”. ”Plans for Pope Benedict’s funeral will be announced in the next few hours,” the Vatican said.   Although the former pontiff had been ill for some time, the Holy See said there had seen an aggravation in his condition because of advancing age. On Wednesday, Pope Francis appealed to his final audience of the year at the Vatican to “pray a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict”, whom he said was very ill.  Born Joseph Ratzinger in Germany, Benedict was 78 when in 2005 he became one of the oldest popes ever elected. For much of his papacy, the Catholic Church faced allegations, legal claims and official reports into decades of child abuse by priests.  Earlier this year the former Pope acknowledged that errors had been made in the handling of abuse cases while he was archbishop of Munich between 1977 and 1982.(NAN)
