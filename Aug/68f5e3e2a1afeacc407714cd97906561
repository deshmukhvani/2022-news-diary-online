By Emmanuel OlaniruhaThe Independent National Electoral Commission INEC has disassociated itself from an online website urging Nigerians to enrol for Permanent Voters Card (PVC).        Management Commission (NIMC) centers.“The Commission states unequivocally that the site is not linked to the commission and the link/portal is spurious and from a dubious source,” he said.    “The commission is solely responsible for organising, undertaking, and supervising national elections in the country and does not share this responsibility with anybody or organisation. “Members of the public are strongly advised not to succumb to the antics of online scammers and should avoid such fake sites.   “The commission has concluded the Continuous Voter Registration nationwide and does not need to open an additional site or portal for the purposes of registration of voters,” he said.
