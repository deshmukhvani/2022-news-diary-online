The experience I have been through in the last four months is not something that I will wish my enemy. The situation was really terrible. In the last two weeks, we were okay. But for the three and a half months we were actually very hungry. There were days we ate once in a day. “I was the medical doctor in the camp. I was treating captives as well as the bandits. There was no medication in the camp. There was a lady who went into coma because there was no medication to treat her of malaria. I will like to call on government to take whatever necessary steps to ensure the release of the remaining people,” he added.
